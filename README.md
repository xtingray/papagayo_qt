Papagayo
========

Lipsync tool for animators

Papagayo 2.0b1
------------------------------------------------------------

This is a beta release of Papagayo - please excuse the lack of documentation.
(Documentation is provided for using the application, but not much about building it.)

Papagayo is a lip-sync application for animators. Please see the manual inside the
installer folder.

What you've downloaded here is the source code to Papagayo. You can modify and build it
as you wish, as long as you follow the terms in the License.txt file.

Papagayo is currently built as a Qt application. To build it you need Qt 5.2.1 installed.
I have built Papagayo for Windows and MacOS X, but I expect it will build for Linux as
well. If anyone wants to try out a Linux build, go for it.

To build Papagayo, open up the file Papagayo.pro in Qt Creator and press the Build
Project button.
